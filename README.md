## ML base including ANN and DTree

This was part of our last assignment for CS 6613-Artificial Intelligence class. I coded it with the intention of making it a simple, general purpose framework for implementing ML models in. The assignment required us to implement DTrees and a simple ANN (with hidden layers). It's been awhile since I last worked on this code, but if I remember correctly, it seemed to be functional, but not producing results that made sense. It needs more debug time. Not sure if it makes sense to spend the time on it at this point, since there are many libraries out there that have already implemented and debugged the functionality we're trying to get to here.

But, I really appreciate the fact that I tried to write this code from scratch. It makes you appreciate things like Scikit Learn and TensorFlow.

It should be noted that most of this class wasn't related to ML. It was primarily intelligent agent concepts, search tree algorithms, etc.
